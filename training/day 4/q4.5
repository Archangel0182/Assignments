Q5 What are identifiers, list rules of identifiers in python?

->Identifiers in Python are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. They are user-defined names used to give a unique identity to elements in a program.

Rules for identifiers in Python:
-An identifier can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_).
-The first character of an identifier cannot be a digit.
-Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning 'name' and 'Name' are considered different identifiers.
-Python keywords (reserved words) cannot be used as identifiers.
-An identifier should not contain any special characters such as symbols or spaces.
-It is good practice to use descriptive and meaningful names for identifiers to improve code readability.
