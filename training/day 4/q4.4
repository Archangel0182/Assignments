Q4 What is difference between mutable and immutable data types in python

->The difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python is as follows:
-Mutable data types: These are the data types whose values can be changed after they are created. Lists and dictionaries are examples of mutable data types. When you modify a mutable object, it doesn't create a new object; instead, it modifies the existing object in memory.
-Immutable data types: These are the data types whose values cannot be changed after they are created. Strings, numbers, and tuples are examples of immutable data types. When you modify an immutable object, it creates a new object in memory with the modified value.
