Q3 What is duck typing in python, what are Dunder or special methods?

->Duck typing in Python refers to a programming concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior rather than its explicit type declaration. It emphasizes the presence of specific methods and attributes rather than the specific type of an object. If an object quacks like a duck (i.e., has the required methods and attributes), it is considered a duck, regardless of its actual type.

Dunder or special methods in Python are special functions with double underscores (underscores before and after the method name) that provide a way to define or customize the behavior of classes. These methods are automatically called by specific language constructs or operators. For example, the __init__ method is called when an object is created, and the __str__ method is called when the object is converted to a string.
