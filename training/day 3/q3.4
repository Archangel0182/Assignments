Q4 What is difference between ordered data type and unordered data type?

->Difference between ordered data type and unordered data type:

-An ordered data type maintains the order of its elements, which means the elements are stored and accessed in a specific sequence. Lists and arrays are examples of ordered data types. The order of elements in these data structures is determined by their position or index.
-On the other hand, an unordered data type does not have a specific order for its elements. The elements can be stored and accessed in any order. Examples of unordered data types include sets and dictionaries in Python. The elements in a set or dictionary are not arranged in a particular sequence, and their order may change over time.
