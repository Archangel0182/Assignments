Q1 What are Data Structures? List some of data structures and their use in real world application? 

->Data Structures are the fundamental building blocks in computer science and programming that allow the storage and organization of data in a structured and efficient manner. They provide operations for accessing, manipulating, and managing data. Different data structures are used depending on the requirements and characteristics of the data.

Some commonly used data structures and their real-world applications include:

-Arrays: Used to store a collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are widely used in various applications, such as storing and accessing sequential data like sensor readings, image pixels, or audio samples.
-Lists: Similar to arrays, but more flexible as they can store elements of different types. Lists are commonly used for implementing dynamic data structures and managing collections of items.
-Linked Lists: Consist of nodes where each node holds a value and a reference to the next node. Linked lists are used in scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required, such as implementing stacks, queues, and dynamic memory allocation.
-Stacks: Follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in programming language parsing, function call management, and undo/redo operations.
-Queues: Follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. Queues are used in scenarios like job scheduling, task management, and breadth-first search algorithms.
-Trees: Hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Trees are used in file systems, database indexing, and organizing hierarchical data like organization charts.
-Graphs: Consist of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Graphs are used in social networks, road networks, and optimization problems like finding the shortest path or identifying clusters.
-Hash Tables: Provide efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations based on key-value pairs. Hash tables are used for implementing dictionaries, symbol tables, and database indexing.
