Q7 Explain what a condition is and where you would use one. 

->A condition is a statement or expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. It is used in control flow statements like `if` statements and loop conditions to make decisions or control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. Conditions help in creating logic and executing specific parts of the code based on whether the condition evaluates to `True` or `False`.
