Q5 What is UDF?  

->UDF (User-Defined Function):
A UDF, or User-Defined Function, refers to a function created by a programmer to perform a specific task within a program. Unlike built-in functions provided by programming languages, UDFs are custom functions tailored to meet specific requirements. They allow developers to modularize their code by encapsulating a set of instructions into a reusable function. UDFs can be called multiple times within a program, providing flexibility, code organization, and reusability.
