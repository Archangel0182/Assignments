Q3 This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement? 

->Expression vs. Statement:
- Expression: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. It can be as simple as a single constant or variable, or more complex with arithmetic or logical operations. Expressions are typically used to compute values or to provide arguments to functions or operators.
- Statement: A statement is a complete instruction that performs a specific action. It can be a single line or a block of code. Statements control the flow of execution in a program, such as variable assignments, control flow structures (if statements, loops), function declarations, and more. Unlike expressions, statements do not produce a value as a result.
